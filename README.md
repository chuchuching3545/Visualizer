# Visualizer

Visualizer is an interactive Unity application designed to display simulation data in a dynamic and engaging way. Developed to bridge the gap between data analysis and visual representation, Visualizer allows users to upload simulation results obtained from Python scripts.

## Features

- **Data Upload:** Easily upload your simulation results to visualize the data.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Start, pause, and resume the visualization at your convenience, allowing for detailed analysis of the simulation data.

## Getting Started
